    "# A Brief Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks combine an execution environment for R/Python/Julia/Haskell with written instructions/documentation/descriptions as markdown. They are organized in _cells_, and each cell has a type. For use, two types of cells are relevant, Markdown and Code. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown Cells\n",
    "The Markdown cells contain textual information that is formatted using Markdown. An explanation for how Markdown works can be found as part of the [Juypter Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html). For this exercise, we use the Markdown cells to provide explanations, define tasks, and ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Cells\n",
    "The code cells contain exectuable code. Each cell is executed on its own and there is no fixed order for the execution. To execute the code in a cell, you simply have to click on the _Run_ button at the top of the page or hit Ctrl+Enter. Code has to be written in R, Python, Julia, or Haskell. All cells within the same notebook must use the same language, which is defined by the kernel of the notebook. We provide the notebooks to you with the Python kernel enabled. You may switch to a different kernel using the menu bar by clicking on Kernel-->Change Kernel and then selecting the language of your choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The internal state\n",
    "While the cells are executed on their own, they all share the same state. For example, if you load a library in one cell, it will be available in all cells. Similarly, if you store something in a variable, this variable will be globally accessible from all other cells. The state can be reset by restarting the kernel. This usually happens automatically, when you re-open the notebook. You can also trigger this manually using the menu bar by clicking on Kernel-->Restart. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Output\n",
    "The output of a code cell appears below the cell. By default, the result of the last executed line is printed. Other textual outputs can be generated by using the print-commands of the programming languange. The generation of plots and similar elements will be covered in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello World\n",
    "\n",
    "Below this cell, you find a code cell that contains the code for printing \"Hello World\" in Python. Execute the cell and see what happens. "

    "# Programming in this Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "You may solve the problems in whichever programming language you desire. You may or may not use Jupyter Notebooks. Within this exercise, we are interested in the interpretation of results, not the programming to achieve this. We give general guidance on how to solve problems with Python as part of the descriptions of the exercises. However, other languages, especially R, are also suited for solving the exerices. However, in case you have programming problems, we will only help you (within reasonable limits) if you use Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please be reminded that these exercises are primarily designed for Computer Science M.Sc. students. Thus, we assume that all students poses basic programming skills and are able to learn new programming languages on their own. We will also usually not comment on your code quality. In case you have no experience in programming (at all) you may find this exercise difficult. If you only have experience with other languages, but not Python, you should be able to solve all tasks using help from the internet without problems. Google and StackOverflow are your friends. "
