    "Your first step is always accessing the data. Often, the data is stored in a database or within files. One common and generic exchange format for files are Comma Separated Value (CSV) files. The first line of such a file indicates the names of the features, the following lines each contain a single instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download the [bankruptcy data set](http://user.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/~sherbold/analcatdata_bankruptcy.csv) we prepared for you and and upload it to your Jupyter notebook. Please note, that we slightly modified the data from the original available in the [UCI archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) UCI for this exercise, e.g., to include missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the cell below to load the data from the CSV file. The data should be loaded into a _data frame_. Data frames are available in python using the ```pandas``` library. In comparison to matrices or similar types, they allow different types of columns, are usually easier to manipulate, e.g., by adding or removing rows/columns, and rows and columns can be named. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done this, print some information about the data:\n",
    "- number of instances\n",
    "- number of features\n",
    "- names of the features\n",

All missing values are marked as NA in the CSV file. \n",
